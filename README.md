# Construction Cost Estimation Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to estimate the cost of construction projects based on input parameters such as materials, labor, and project size. The model is trained on historical data using various machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks. The model's accuracy is evaluated using performance metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anupamag8/construction-cost-estimation.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd construction-cost-estimation
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Prepare your dataset:**

   The dataset is in a CSV file format with columns `Materials`, `Labor`, `ProjectSize`, and `Cost`.

## Usage

1. **Place dataset in the project directory:**

   Ensure dataset is named `construction_data.csv` and located in the root directory of the project.

2. **Run the code:**

   Execute the script to train the model and estimate construction costs:

   ```bash
   python construction_cost_estimation.py
   ```

3. **Switching Models:**

   Choose between Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks by uncommenting the desired model in the code.

## Models

The following machine learning models are implemented for construction cost estimation:

- **Linear Regression**: A simple yet powerful regression model.
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**: An ensemble model that combines the predictions of multiple weak learners.
- **MLPRegressor (Neural Network)**: A neural network-based regression model for more complex non-linear relationships.

## Evaluation Metrics

The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Measures the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual values.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average absolute differences between predicted and actual values.

## Results

After running the script, the model will output the following:
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) value
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE) value
- A scatter plot comparing the actual and predicted construction costs.
